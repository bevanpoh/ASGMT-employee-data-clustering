# Repository Info

This repository contains work done for my AI & Machine Learning Module Assignment 2 at SP
The scope of the assignment consisted of using unsupervised clustering algorithms to cluster tabular employee data containing attributes such as age, salary, education level, etc. to investigate the turnover rate between groups of companies

- `data` contains the dataset with the employee data and a metadata file
- `clustering.ipynb` contains code for the entire modelling process documented with markdown comments
